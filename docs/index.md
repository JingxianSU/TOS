  tagline: >
    Trustworthy True Orchestration of AIs and Systems is an architectural approach in which multiple intelligent systems
    and operational components are coordinated under an explicit, enforceable control-plane.
    Beyond mere functional orchestration, this approach embeds trustworthiness as a first-class property, ensuring that
    all actions, decisions, data flows, and executions are policy-governed, verifiable, auditable, explainable, and
    traceable across their entire lifecycle.
    Governance is not advisory or implicit, but technically binding—ensuring that system behaviour remains aligned with
    defined purposes, risk constraints, accountability requirements, and human oversight, even as underlying AI models,
    services, and integrations evolve.
